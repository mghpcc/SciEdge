# About this project:

The Ecosystem for Research Networking (formerly the Eastern Regional Network) has partnered with the Rutgers CryoEM & Nanoimaging Facility (RCNF) to launch the CryoEM Federated Instrument Pilot Project whose goal is to facilitate inter-institutional collaboration at the interface of computing and electron microscopy by removing many of the barriers encountered when accessing these resources. The ecosystem being developed through this active pilot targets breaking down resource access barriers,  foster team science and the democratization of scientific  instruments to benefit the research community, with emphasis on under-represented and under-resourced colleges and institutions, who typically do not have access to these resources, nor expertise to take full advantage of them. By design, it is anticipated that through community modifications other science domains can take advantage of this ecosystem to the benefit of their researchers. The project design solution, software, containers, ansible recipes, and documentation is available to the research community through the github repository,  https://github.com/mghpcc/ERN-Remote-Scientific-Instrument.

Our pilot site, the Rutgers CryoEM & Nanoimaging Facility, specializes in nano- and atomic-scale imaging of cells, molecules, and soft matter preserved in its native state by vitrification. It is housed in Rutgers' Institute for Quantitative Biomedicine, an interdisciplinary research institute where scientists leverage quantitative tools of measurement and analysis from chemistry, computer science, engineering, mathematics, physics, and statistics to address biomedical challenges.

This project has been funded in part by the following NSF grants: NSF OAC-2018927 and OAC-1925482
